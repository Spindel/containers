# Containers

Generic project which runs application containers for the sysadmin team.

Things that live here should:

1. Not be developed by us in gitlab ( then it should have it's own)
1. Be tracked on release cadence and/or master
1. Be maintained somewhere/how



So, to avoid random forked projects like "oauth2" or others, or to get a
container with some minor, or sometimes major, changes to them, put them here.

However, this is all for _production_ stuff. This is not for your build infra
container (base-image or otherwhere).
